None
====

In addition to the standard types like :doc:`strings` and :doc:`numbers`, Python
has a special data type that defines a single special data object called
``None``. As the name suggests, ``None`` is used to represent an empty value. It
appears in various forms in Python. For example, a procedure in Python is just a
function that does not explicitly return a value, which means that it returns
``None`` by default.

``None`` is often useful in everyday Python programming as a placeholder to
indicate a data structure where meaningful data may eventually be found, even if
that data has not yet been computed. The presence of ``None`` is easy to check
because there is only one instance of ``None`` in the entire Python system (all
references to ``None`` point to the same object), and ``None`` is identical only
to itself.
